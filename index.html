              <p><strong>You know how it goes…</strong></p>
              <p>You promise yourself you'll be good this year.</p>
              <p>You'll "just have one plate."</p>
              <p>You'll "skip dessert."</p>
              <p>And yet… a few hours later, your plate's full again, your jeans are tight, and that little voice in your head is whispering, "I'll start over Monday."</p>
              <p><strong>Sound familiar?</strong></p>
              <p>Then Thanksgiving rolls into Christmas, and by January you're feeling bloated, guilty, and frustrated — wondering why you lost control again.</p>
              <p><strong>The truth? It's not your fault.</strong></p>
              <p>You don't overeat because you lack discipline.</p>
              <p>You overeat because your nervous system is overwhelmed.</p>
              <p>Food becomes your way to calm down, feel safe, and keep the peace — especially when family stress, loneliness, and emotions run high.</p>
              <p>And until you address that emotional trigger, no amount of "willpower" will make the cravings stop.</p>

          <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
          <p>Most programs teach you how to “stay on track” through the holidays by counting points, cutting carbs, or relying on willpower.</p>
          <p><strong>This one goes straight to the root.</strong></p>
          <p>You'll learn how to calm the stress, emotions, and subconscious patterns that cause you to overeat in the first place, so you don't have to fight with food at all. And you can actually enjoy holiday food without losing control.</p>
          <p><span class="underlined">This isn't another diet challenge.</span> It's emotional reprogramming for the season that triggers you most.</p>

            <li>Peaceful and calm around food</li>
            <li>Confident in your body (even through the holidays)</li>
            <li>Free from guilt and not triggered to emotionally eat</li>
            <li>Empowered with tools that last far beyond December</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="urgency">But don't wait… We have a limited number of seats for the live calls and they always fill up fast. Once we hit Zoom capacity, registration closes.</p>
